I have created a React project for a sneaker website with features like category filtering, price sorting, rating filtering, a shopping cart, and a login page using ReactJS and Bootstrap. I have made 3 different sections that filter sneakers on the basis of category, price, and rating. I tried making the cart work out but I cannot complete it within the deadline it needs more work.
